      <div class="caption" id="abt_caption"><p>I'm an American student living and going to school in Edinburgh, Scotland, for the autumn of 2016. I decided to create a photo blog because I wanted to share my experience with those closest to me. I usually post pictures to Facebook, but many people who are important to me (like, say, my parents) don't have an account and I wanted to be sure they could see the pictures without my having to change the privacy settings. Also, I'm trying to break, or at least lessen, my Facebook habit. Anyway, I hope you enjoy!</p>
        <h2>Contact</h2><p>If you don't have at least one way of contacting me, I have literally no idea how you found this. But, obviously you did, so if you need to complain (or compliment???), I can also be reached at sarahssojourns@gmail.com.<br/> All pictures taken by me, with exception of ones I'm featured in (although even some of those, like the one above, are taken on self-timer)</p></div>
