      var intro ='<h2>Craigmillar Castle and Park</h2><p id ="abt_caption">Craigmillar Castle, which is one of the most-well preserved medieval castles in Scotland (according to signs there), is situated about 3 miles south of Edinburgh&apos;s city center. The oldest parts of the castle date back to the 14th century (according to Wikipedia), built by the Preston family. Construction continued over the next two centuries, before the castle fell into ruin in the 18th century. Mary, Queen of Scots, stayed in the castle for several months following the birth of her son.</p>';
