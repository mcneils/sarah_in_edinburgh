The oldest parts of the castle date back to the 14th century (according to Wikipedia), built by the Preston family. Construction continued over the next two centuries, before the castle fell into ruin in the 18th century. Mary, Queen of Scots, stayed in the castle for several months following the birth of her son.</p><p>Click on the right arrow to go forward a slide, the left to go back one.</p></div> ');
