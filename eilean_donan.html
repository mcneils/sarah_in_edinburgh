The castle was essentially destroyed in some of the Jacobite uprisings in the eighteenth century. In the twentieth century, the McRae family rebuilt the castle and, much to the disappointment of my family and myself, it serves as a museum to them. (We were really hoping for some bloody clan history.)</p>';
